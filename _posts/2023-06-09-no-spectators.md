# Communication is active participation

Do not be a spectator.

Read, Appraise, Annotate, Think Critically

# COMMIT to improving your communication strategies, tactics and skills.

Read more. Get better at reading faster by reading a LOT MORE. Use ChatGPT or large language models to read for you ... but read that output more critically to expand your reading.

Compare, contrast, draw distinctions, understand value, appraise.

Annotate. Use communication technologies that notify you of others' contributions.  Get better at using your notification dashboards.

THINK more ... go for walks, get a change of scenery ... THINK! THINK! THINK! When ideas occur to you, use your smart device to make a note to yourself.

Use and Extend Git, Gerrit, Zulip.

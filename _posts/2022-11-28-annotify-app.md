The point of the Annotify app is to learn faster ... ***we learn faster by learning both from others who are learning faster*** 

This means that our "app" or learning and research toolchain will be blatantly stolen from what is working best ... since we rely primarily upon FREE open source tools, that means that we use the toolchains with an aim toward to building something better ... approaching every tool with [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) mentality.

----------------------------

Although, we cannot emphasize the [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) nature of this enough ... the point of the Annotify project is to be more aware of developments that impact what we are trying to develop -- we are not interested in buzz or hype, but instead we are interested in major themes and significant developments that are indeed practically changing the landscape ... real change, positive improvement, things that are PROVING to be significant, genuine, permanent advances ... it's not about those hyped products with claim to be major advances.

The intention of our little Sci Ops knowledge graph project is to develop something that might eventually be useful enough mature into a community project ... maybe that will never happen ... but we aim to to use our annotifiable, recursively neural, knowledge graph analyic toolchain enough so that it's valuable ... at first, the value is just for us learning and [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)  a toolchain and contributing to those learning open source projects which are most efficaciously advancing the learning cause.

The general philosophical approach to learning is fundamentally about using millions of internetworked developers who are developing for billions of internetworked power users ... crowdliness is about learning at scale ... ***we learn faster and better by learning from the best of the best 10X-ers or even 100X-ers or 1000X-ers who are learning faster and better while distilling our understanding so that we are able to share our skills for how we ARE learning.*** ... 

Learning at scale ... or crowdliness ... is effectively a matter of using rising tides and larger waves from gigantic meta-RNN ocean of continually updating models ... trying to hold back the sea is impossible; it's necessary to master the sea.

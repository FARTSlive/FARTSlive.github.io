The plan is to use an ANNOTATED prioritizable, sortable bullet-point checklist for agenda  ... the artifact of such a checklist, is somewhat like document ... in the Git repository, what is actually stored is would like the DIFF from the recent version, ie multiple copies of data from the current app framework form could be stored very efficiently. 

So the app would behaves like a document ... with data to populate the form being compressed, as it is in Git repositories ... all issues, wiki, projects, affliated commentary would follow the Git repository ... of course, public ANNOTIFY.app repositories would be entirely forkable.  Since it behaves like a Git repository, it would be amenable to use of things like GitPod.io ... or visual tools like GitKraken ... replicable between BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab, et al.

***Frankly, almost of all of ANNOTIFY.app has pretty much already been built, RIGHT?***  Yup, so effectively ANNOTIFY.app is just a matter or using the best of the best Git tools and developing an ANNOTIFY workflow arround it [for the not yet, Git-enlightend].

# The exhaustively-annotated, but yet still compact workflow

The plan is to use an ANNOTATED prioritizable, sortable bullet-point checklist for agenda  ... the artifact of such a checklist, is somewhat like document [or can be printed/emailed as a separate document/spreadsheet/CAD file/etc].  

The fully verbose data, with pictures, CAD files, audio with meta-data is stored ... in especially compact Git-ified format ... in the Git repository, what is so small... because only the DIFFs are actually stored per the graph back to the recent version, ie so multiple copies of data from the current app framework form could be stored extremely efficiently. 

So the annotify workflow app would behave like a document ... with data for all issues, wiki, projects, affliated email/phone/text conversatiions, verbose commentary, as with a CRM-tool or workorder tool for service technicians being associated with the workflow graph in the distributed version-controlled repositories we use in Git

Which, of course means, that the public ANNOTIFY.app repositories would also be entirely forkable and amenable to Git tools.  Since annotify.app behaves like a Git repository, all kinds of tools like GitKraken or GitPod.io would work with it ... and entirely mirror-able between BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab and other Git hosts.


***SO ... frankly, almost of all of ANNOTIFY.app has pretty much already been built, RIGHT?***  Absolutely!  In other words, effectively using ANNOTIFY.app is just a matter of using and extending the very best of the best Git tools and developing an ANNOTIFY workflow around it [for just an app] ... for the not yet, Git-enlightend or those who will always be kind of operating in a serverless Githost-agnostic user fashion, with nothing but a smartphone, tablet or Chromebook.

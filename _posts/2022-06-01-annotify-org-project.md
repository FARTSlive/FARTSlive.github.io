We started a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/annotifyapp/projects/1) ... with the intention of maybe using the GH's project infrastructure as way to coordinate the ongoing review of papers.

**Annotify is about making knowledgework FUNNER ... so we need a workflow that is FUN.** *Well, sort of fun ... if you like workflows or find comfort in a somewhat structured workflow.*

We sort of need a general project architecture or a work breakdown structure ... to let everyone know where things are at. 

### Brainstorming New Ideas

What should we be thinking about

### Parked Ideas in ThinkerLand

Not abandoned ... but ideas that we just don't know what we can do immediately ... ***still very important*** for spurring thought, conversation, more effort

### Waiting For Other Developments

Categorized as higher priortity ideas; likely to move immediately up to the ***Complete and Review ASAP*** category ... but right now we're waiting for ____

### Low Priority TBDs

Nice to have, stuff we should get to soon, but other fires are burning hotter

### Complete and Review ASAP

### Done, Reviewed And Onward

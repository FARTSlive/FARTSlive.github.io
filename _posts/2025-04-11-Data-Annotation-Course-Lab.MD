# Data Annotation Course Practical Lab

This lab assignment is about [comparing Firebase Studio’s Git integration with Gemini-assisted workflows to GitButler’s UI for branch tasks](https://x.com/i/grok?conversation=1910719920389669087) will look at how we might pull this off for a knowledge engineering project that involves collaborative graph coding across agriculture, music, and medical imaging domains. 

Both toolchains aim to streamline Git workflows but approach branch tasks differently, impacting how your team manages task-oriented development, collaboration, and version control for a visualization tool. 

In the lab discussion, we will compare the two for specific branch tasks (e.g., creating, committing, merging, and reviewing branches), focusing on their usability, AI assistance, and fit for your project’s collaborative and graph-coding needs. We will do our best to keep this concise yet detailed, emphasizing practical differences and future-proofing for your flexibility across platforms like Azure or AWS.

# Knowledge work is ASYNCHRONOUS communication

Organizations are still organized around face-to-face boss-man-to-slaves plantation-style communication, but knowledge work is predominantly ASYNCHRONOUS -- it IS easier for a group to lift a large object together, but in the realm of knowledge work it is NOT easier to have a meeting room full of a-hole yesmen leaning in to seek facetime with the boss to *lift* a big idea ... in fact, it's more likely that the room is packed with the wrong people OR that the right people are scattered around the globe, not just in different time zones but with different priorities and very different sleep/work/family/play schedules.

The PROBLEM is that bossman slaveowner types still love being stroked ... and cocksucker yesmen still are proud of their lean in skills and being selected to getting on their knees and pleasure the bossman ... so the SYNCRONOUS on-site work schedule persists even there is no physical justification for it.

The FACT of the matter is that although physical *lifting stuff together* work is best accomplished in a SYNCHRONOUS fashion ... knowledge work is primarily about ASYNCHRONOUS communication. Choosing and extending the [right OPEN SOURCE tools for efficient asynchronous communication](https://zulip.com/why-zulip/) WILL provide a massive productivity boost ... it's all about extensibility because the barriers to productivity will be removed when people stop assembling knowledge the way Henry Ford built Model Ts and start becoming aware of lean thinking, lean knowledge, lean ideas, lean communication and taking out the non-value-added waste that is an impediment to higher productivity in that realm ... the magic of open source happens when knowledge workers begin to tailor and extend their own asynchronous assemblyline in the virtual realm.

# Use D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. to see waste and eliminate it

D) Read more, really read the **DOCUMENTATION** and the **DISCUSSION**. Understand the basis for past decisions. If a decision needs to be revisited or reversed, fine -- but be up to speed on why things have developed as they have.

O) No **OVERPOLISHING** or **OVERPRODUCTION** or **OVERTHINKING**... use LEAN startup approach to develop the minimal viable product and ship something that works so that it can be tested in production.

W) Stop **WAITING.** Make decisions with timebound, ie next hour or next day, input from all stakeholders, not only without commuting but without the overhead of scheduling a meeting to get everyone in place to make a decision.

N) NEVER accept **NOT LISTENING.** Commit to being a better example of a better listener inside an organization that listens. Above all commit to being more present for the more important stuff ... if something demands a phone call or a personal visit, that is what it takes -- but mostly it's going to require constant improvement of better listening skills.

T) **TRANSPORT** less. Instead of commuting commit to making asynch communication substantive.  

I) Use **ISSUE-BASED** development. Don't shuffle **INFORMATION** needlessly. Use tags and topic-based threading. Demand better commit discipline for conventional commits. Master instant delivery chat with asynchronous notifications. Learn to rely upon commitgraph dashboards. Use emoji reaction to indicate mood. 

M) Avoid **MEETINGS** or other motion for the sake of appearing to move. Using one-piece agenda to discuss complex topics and Focusing on the work, not dialing into a Zoom or teleconf.

E) Stop feeding strong **EGOS** -- there's no room for prima donnas. We must realizing that we all have egos ... bullying should never be tolerated, but also stop trying to over-coddle victims who migth interpret a careless remark as bullying ... we can be successful together if we try a bit harder to love, understand and respect others as if we were in their shoes.

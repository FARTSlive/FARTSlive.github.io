# Knowledge work is ASYNCHRONOUS communication

Organizations are still organized around face-to-face boss-man-to-slaves plantation-style communication, but knowledge work is predominantly ASYNCHRONOUS -- it IS easier for a group to lift a large object together, but in the realm of knowledge work it is NOT easier to have a meeting room full of a-hole yesmen leaning in to seek facetime with the boss to *lift* a big idea ... in fact, it's more likely that the room is packed with the wrong people OR that the right people are scattered around the globe, not just in different time zones but with different priorities and very different sleep/work/family/play schedules.

The PROBLEM is that bossman slaveowner types still love being stroked ... and cocksucker yesmen still are proud of their lean in skills and being selected to getting on their knees and pleasure the bossman ... so the SYNCRONOUS on-site work schedule persists even there is no physical justification for it.

The FACT of the matter is that although physical *lifting stuff together* work is best accomplished in a SYNCHRONOUS fashion ... knowledge work is primarily about ASYNCHRONOUS communication. Choosing and extending the [right OPEN SOURCE tools for efficient asynchronous communication](https://zulip.com/why-zulip/) WILL provide a massive productivity boost ... it's all about extensibility because the barriers to productivity will be removed when people stop assembling knowledge the way Henry Ford built Model Ts and start becoming aware of lean thinking, lean knowledge, lean ideas, lean communication and taking out the non-value-added waste that is an impediment to higher productivity in that realm ... the magic of open source happens when knowledge workers begin to tailor and extend their own asynchronous assemblyline in the virtual realm.

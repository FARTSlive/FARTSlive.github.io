# 100 Major Recent Developments in AI Engineering & Data Annotation

*The Singularity has lost its head and is going to be wondering around out in the weeds making a mess for the next couple decades.*

I have been trained by the generally abysmal quality of the actual information produced to skim, rather than actually read AI analysis about as fast as it is produced... and to generally give it that level of credence, until I have actually read and re-wrote it.

In other words, AI is okay for brainstorming and wild-ass ideation, but not something anyone can/should trust ... because the available evidence is still indicating that *information* generated is barely worth the electrons it is printed on, but it's not at all bad for a rapid machine-driven regurgitation, ie it's neither original or that likely to actually reliably get it right.

Consider the AI opinion of 100 major recent developments in AI engineering & data annotation, ie it's machine-regurgitated low-rate PR hypeware.

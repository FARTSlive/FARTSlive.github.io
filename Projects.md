# Listing of Open Source Projects Which Are Related to Annotify

We are commitizens for other projects ... that means that are not necessarily interested in leading the parade there, but we intend to follow it, fork a repo and look at the code, pay attention to what the issues are, cheer for it where we get an opporunity, critique it when we see something questionable, throw our two cents in and comment upon general direction and hopefully maybe we get to roll up our sleeves, not just to *fill sandbags* but to actually advance the cause of other projects.

There are far too many topics to list which tie in to Annotify.ORG, but our aim is to have roughly 125 project tangencies in the *hopper* of relationships that we need to pay attention to, to have 25 that we work on at least once a month, to have five that we touch once a week and to have ONE main project tangency that we are focusing on TODAY ... 

1) Annotify is fundamentally all about using *in-browser development workstation* ***WITH AI/MLops PLUG-INS*** ... for the completely uninitatted that means [VSCode.dev](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev) ... but, more correctly, the idea is ORIGINALLY inspired by the work of [GitPod.io on Github](https://github.com/gitpod-io) and [The GitPod developer community](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/contribute). We will pretty much try to adhere to the de facto standard in these sorts of browser-based codespaces which, for the time-being at least, mean [GitPod Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/gitpod-io/projects/27/views/1) ... but, of course, there will be developments in the [GitHub *Codespaces* topic](https://github.com/topics/github-codespaces) which also influence the directions of these things. 

2) If [Doublind](https://twitter.com/blinddou?lang=en) were open source and on Git or something like a forkable DVCS, we would contribute to that project ... we really, really like the [Doublind](https://twitter.com/blinddou?lang=en) concept ... our intention is develop social peer-review DECENTRALIZED or git-based repository [or organization of repositories] that would be forkable like the AWESOME repositories ... our goal is to exploit Github functionality [by adding code if necessary, but ideally contributing to the GitHub functionality] that would facilitate the process of reviewers making private annotations [for only their own use] before commiting a public review comment under a formal, authenticated peer-review process, upvoting papers [after being formally id'd and authenticated, so there's no ballot box stuffing or even stuffing by personna accounts] and notifying the paper authors and other reviewers of the paper. In other words, "blind" does not equal annonymous, alt personna or devalued fake account ... but some approach to AUTHENTICATED social peer-review is the objective.

3) There is a lot of research being done in the *not all that secret* [***neuro-secret-sauce of AnnotifyApp***](https://annotifyapp.github.io/template/2022/05/01/optimized-neuroadvantage.html). Our interest in annotification and notification is all about managing the complexity from all of engineering and scientific interactions that have to happen in order for us to take our level of engineering to the ecosystem, planetary and cosmological level. In order to level up system engineering by orders of magnitude like this, we have to do a much better job at optimizing human neurological function and that extends to the optimization of emotions, moods and thorny interpersonal differences ... *playing well together* is a matter of neuro-optimization and meditative thoughtfulness, ie to predictably *get along* with team members as if EACH workweek were the greatest seminar with a yogi in mountains of Tibet ever attended by mortals.

4) Project Jupyter / Colab / Kaggle / JetBrains and a host of other platforms for collaboratively working on Jupyter notebooks ... this technology is CORE to what we are about ... .

5) Most [startup accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator) are almost gauranteed to produce failures, ie actually can be studied as examples of what not to do ... but some, [YCombinator and HackerNews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator), [VentureHacks and ProductHunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngelList), [TechStars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techstars) have decidely better odds ... there are new, innovative ideas like MicroAcquire [and BuildSell30] which leverage the notion of [hackathons, code sprints, datathons, codefests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) for the startup realm.

6) GitHub / GitLab ... the differences inform. For example, why did GitLab get ANY traction when GitHub was already so dominant?

7) SnakeMake and [Arxiv Labs](https://labs.arxiv.org/),ConnectedPapers and the whole realm of things affiliated to pre-print Archives

8) [CDNjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/) the business ... as well as [the CDNjs GitHub repositories](https://github.com/cdnjs) and [VUEjs](https://github.com/vuejs) the [architecture behind progressive web apps (PWAs)](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-progressive-web-app-architectures) including things like [the GitHub repos](https://github.com/jamstack) driving [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/)

9) Truly OPEN machine learning, deep learning and open AI ... because of OpenAI GPT-4? Meh, not exactly ... more open ... we'll see how the world of closed proprietary open AI goes ... maybe it will work. We do respect the connections and hype of thing like Google DeepMind or OpenAI or anyone that can hire the best of the best in terms of evangelists and armies of PR mafia ... we're not being critical -- the level of networking and connection maintenance necessary to drive the hype surrounding something like GPT-4 is basically unparalleled in human history ... we study and admire proprietary companies for their approach to networking, not necessarily the AI itself ... although, their AI itself is not at all bad either. It's just that all AI practioners really need to *wise up* and understand how much of role HYPE and emotion plays in the world of human beings ... who work on and invest in AI.

10) Newsblur and other RSS newsfeed readers 

11) AWESOME repositories and curated collections ... and the process of curated, annotated listification

12) The [Anaconda Community](https://community.anaconda.cloud/) has a substantial impact on how we view reliable foundations, which just work ... this particularly pertains to something like the basic [Conda infrastructure](https://github.com/annotifyapp/conda) OS-agnostic, system-level binary package manager and ecosystem -- it is perhaps not perfect, but it is used because it is just flat out more reliable and requires less arcane hackery to support

13) [PyTorch](https://github.com/annotifyapp/pytorch) ... Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration

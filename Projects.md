*Open Source projects are like art or painting or music ... except better ... but we're biased.*

# Listing of Open Source Projects Which Are Related to Annotify

We are commitizens for other projects ... that means that are not necessarily interested in leading the parade there, but we intend to follow it, fork a repo and look at the code, pay attention to what the issues are, cheer for it where we get an opporunity, critique it when we see something questionable, throw our two cents in and comment upon general direction and hopefully maybe we get to roll up our sleeves, not just to *fill sandbags* but to actually advance the cause of other projects.

There are far too many topics to list which tie in to Annotify.ORG, but our aim is to have roughly 125 project tangencies in the *hopper* of relationships that we need to pay attention to, to have 25 that we work on at least once a month, to have five that we touch once a week and to have ONE main project tangency that we are focusing on TODAY ... 

1) VSCode / GitPod / Codespaces ... 

2) Doublind

3) Project Jupyter / Colab

4) SnakeMake

5) Most [startup accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator) are almost gauranteed to produce failures, ie actually can be studied as examples of what not to do ... but some, [YCombinator and HackerNews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator), [VentureHacks and ProductHunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngelList), [TechStars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techstars) have decidely better odds ... there are new, innovative ideas like MicroAcquire [and BuildSell30] which leverage the notion of [hackathons, code sprints, datathons, codefests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) for the startup realm.

6) GitHub / GitLab ... the differences inform. For example, why did GitLab get ANY traction when GitHub was already so dominant?

7) [Arxiv Labs](https://labs.arxiv.org/), ConnectedPapers and the whole realm of things affiliated to pre-print Archives

8) [CDNjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/) the business ... as well as [the CDNjs GitHub repositories](https://github.com/cdnjs) and [VUEjs](https://github.com/vuejs) the [architecture behind progressive web apps (PWAs)](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-progressive-web-app-architectures) including things like [the GitHub repos](https://github.com/jamstack) driving [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/)

9) OpenAI ... because of GPT-4? Meh ... we'll see; probably not. We do respect the connections and hype of the OpenAI mafia ... we're not being critical -- the level of networking and connection maintenance necessary to drive the hype surrounding something like GPT-4 is basically unparalleled ... we study OpenAI for their approach to networking, not necessarily the AI itself ... but the AI is not bad either. It's just that AI practioners really need to *wise up* and understand how much of role HYPE and emotion plays in the world of PEOPLE ... who work on AI.

10) Newsblur and other RSS newsfeed readers 

11) AWESOME repositories and curated collections

12) The [Anaconda Community](https://community.anaconda.cloud/) has a substantial impact on how we view reliable foundations, which just work ... this particularly pertains to something like the basic [Conda infrastructure](https://github.com/annotifyapp/conda) OS-agnostic, system-level binary package manager and ecosystem -- it is perhaps not perfect, but it is used because it is just flat out more reliable and requires less arcane hackery to support

13) [PyTorch](https://github.com/annotifyapp/pytorch) ... Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration

14) [PyTorch Tutorial](https://github.com/annotifyapp/pytorch-tutorial)PyTorch Tutorial for Deep Learning Researchers

15) [PyTorch Geometric Library](https://github.com/annotifyapp/pytorch_geometric) ... a Graph Neural Network Library for PyTorch

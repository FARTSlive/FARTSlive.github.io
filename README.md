# Annotations/tagging and AI-driven notifications coach collaborative hybrid cognitive intelligence.

Annotated peer-review and discussions for building better knowledge graph datasets and connections between scientific research literature ... really about re-usability of what is working pretty well now ... annotations, currated lists, issues, pull requests, merge requests, code and packages, models and trained datasets.

At first, it's just a matter of  exploration ...  we expect that the app will rely upon:

* Git, GitHub Actions/Codespaces, [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html), Gerrit, Lit

* Various package management architectures ... such as [Conda package mgmt](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), FlatPak, RPEL, dnf, yum, apt, apk pip, 

* Pythonic [data science infrastructure] including the [Jupyter architecture](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html) and the [standard .ipynb JSON notebook schema](https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat), [SnakeMake workflow mgmt system](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), as well as others, like [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Amazon EMR JupyterHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-jupyterhub.html) or others which use a similar, ***nearly*** standard architecture.

* FreeBSD jails, containers, Podman, Docker

* Rentable BigCompute
